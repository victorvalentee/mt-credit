## Features

- Retrieve a list of all credit cards in the database.
- Retrieve a specific credit card by its card number.
- Store new credit card data in the database with proper data validation.
    - Securely store credit card data with encryption.
    - Comprehensive data validation triggers to ensure data integrity.

## Installation

To get started with mt-credit, follow these installation steps:

0. [Pre-requisites] For this guide to work, you should have the following programs installed:
    - [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download)
    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    - [`curl`](https://curl.se/download.html) [Recommended]

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/victorvalentee/mt-credit.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd mt-credit
    ```

3. Build the app Docker image:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Test Suite

There are two test modules: one for the data validation and one for API routes / server functionality.

```bash
make test
```

### Running the Application:

This will fire up the Flask server in the container and foward it to the localhost.

**The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.**

```bash
make run
```

### Sending Requests

You can interact with the application by sending HTTP requests. I'm using `curl`, but you can do this with other tools such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and some of these requests can be sent direclty from the browser:

- **List all credit cards:**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/credit-card
  ```

- **Retrieve a specific credit card by card number:**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/credit-card/1234567890123456
  ```

- **Store a new credit card:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"exp_date": "2025-12-31", "holder_name": "John Doe", "card_number": "4111111111111111", "cvv": 123}' http://localhost:5000/api/v1/credit-card
  ```

## Architecture Overview
![Architecture Overview](docs/img/architecture_overview.png)

The architeture of this app can be divided into three sections:
1. Database
2. Functions
3. API

## Misc
### In-Schema Data Validation
These are the data validations constraints enforced at schema level:
- Account holder name must have at least 3 characters.
- CVV must be NULL or have either 3 or 4 characters.
- Expiration date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
- Expiration date must be in the future.
- Expiration date is set to the end of the month after insert.

### Off-Schema Data Validation
Credit card number validation and encryption will be handled at API level.
